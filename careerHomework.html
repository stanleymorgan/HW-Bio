	  My name is Stan Morgan, I am from Rutherfordton, NC.  I currently serve in the South Carolina National Guard and have been deployed to the Middle East three times for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.  I was awarded the Army Commendation Medal and the Joint Commendations Medal for my service in Iraq and Afghanistan.  My occupation is in satellite communications with a data communications unit.  My interest in web development was piqued by my experience in data communications.  My experience in the National Guard has given me discipline, commitment to the mission and perseverance, qualities that transfer to any other leadership role.  As a team chief I led six soldiers, and acted as liaison to higher command.  I enjoy tennis, reading history, current events and running.
